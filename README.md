# Overview

 The game that I created is the base of a platformer game.

I wrote this software to demonstrate basic familiarity with the Unity Editor.

The controls are:
* The a Button and left arrow for movement to the left.
* The d Button and right arrow for movement to the right.
* The space bar for a jump.
